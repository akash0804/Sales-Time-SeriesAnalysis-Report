Key Insights
Product-Level Insights
Product Growth: Products F and G showed substantial growth in 2023, with growth rates of 189.55% and 205.04%, respectively.
Market Leaders: Products A, B, and C had the highest market shares, although they experienced a decline in sales during 2023.
Underperforming Products: Products E and H consistently underperformed across all store segments, suggesting possible inefficiencies in their marketing or inventory.
Store-Level Insights
Low-Performing Stores: Surprisingly, low-segment stores contributed significantly to the sales of key products, indicating possible overstocking.
Medium-Segment Stores: Underperformed across most products, indicating room for operational improvements or supply chain fixes.
High-Segment Stores: While performing better than medium-segment stores, high-tier stores did not fully capitalize on sales potential.
Supply Chain Insights
Stock Imbalances: Evidence of overstocking in low-performing stores and understocking in high-performing stores. Optimizing inventory distribution could address these inefficiencies.
Demand Forecasting: Improvement in demand forecasting and inventory replenishment strategies can prevent stockouts in medium-segment stores and ensure consistent sales growth.
Visualizations
BCG Matrix: A scatter plot showing product performance based on market growth rate and relative market share.
